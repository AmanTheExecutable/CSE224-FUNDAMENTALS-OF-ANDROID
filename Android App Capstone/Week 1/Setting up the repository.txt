Enter the directory by typing the following line in the terminal:
$ git clone https://github.com/coursera/little-lemon.git 

Step 8
Enter the repository and check the list of files. If the cloning process is successful, you should have a list like the following:
$ cd little-lemon
$ ls -la 
total 5 
drwxr-xr-x 1 ********** 4096  0 Dec  2 09:58 ./ 
drwxr-xr-x 1 ********** 4096  0 Dec  2 09:58 ../ 
drwxr-xr-x 1 ********** 4096  0 Dec  2 09:58 .git/ 
-rw-r--r-- 1 ********** 4096 14 Dec  2 09:58 README.md 

Step 9
Open a newfile.txt file with vi, by typing the following command in the terminal:
$ vi newfile.txt

Step 10
Check the Git status using the $ git status command.

Step 11
Add the newfile.txt to the stage with the $ git add command.

Step 12
Commit the changes with the $ git commit command.

Step 13
Check the status again with the $ git status command.

Step 14
Push the changes with the $ git push command.

Step 15
Refresh the GitHub repository page to check that the pushed file appears. 
Edit the file on GitHub, add some text and commit the changes.

Step 16
Finally, go back to Git bash shell and pull the repository to update the local repository, using the $ git pull command.
